# This script serves as the
# [**Python Buildpack**](https://github.com/heroku/heroku-buildpack-python)
# detector.
#
# A [buildpack](http://devcenter.heroku.com/articles/buildpacks) is an
# adapter between a Python application and Heroku's runtime.

# ## Usage
# Compiling an app into a slug is simple:
#
#     $ bin/detect <build-dir> <cache-dir>

BUILD_DIR=$1

# Exit if the conda-requirements.txt and conda-runtime.txt are specified
if [ -f $BUILD_DIR/conda-requirements.txt ] && [ -f $BUILD_DIR/conda-runtime.txt ]; then
  echo Python/Conda
  exit 0
fi

# Exit if there is an environment.yml
if [ -f $BUILD_DIR/environment.yml ]; then
  echo Python/Conda
  exit 0
fi

exit 1
